<h1 align="center">CAP - Certified Asset Provenance</h1>

<h3 align="center">Transaction history & asset provenance for NFTâ€™s & Tokens on the Internet Computer</h3>

> CAP is an open internet service providing transaction history & asset provenance for NFTâ€™s & Tokens on the Internet Computer. It solves the huge IC problem that assets donâ€™t have native transaction history, and does so in a scalable, trustless and seamless way so any NFT/Token can integrate with one line of code.

This repository has the base codebase **(in development)**, for all the canisters involved in the CAP open internet service.

For integrations visit the CAP Motoko or RUST SDK repositories (see links below) in the case of Tokens/NFTs wanting to integrate CAP to have a transaction history; and the [CAP-js repository](https://github.com/Psychedelic/cap-js/) for UIs that want to surface transaction history data for users from CAP. Our simply visit our **documentation page**.

>**IMPORTANT:** CAP is currently in development ðŸš§ and will release in the first week of November, thus it is not on mainnet or usable yet. You might see our documentation is light on the SDK/Main repo still. We're delayed in this to focus on testing, but will soon update this page with guides & detailed examples for developers.


## Canisters in CAP

This repository contains am implementation for the [spec](./spec.md) described for this OIS, which requires multiple canisters to act with each other, currently there are the following canisters:

1. **Router**: The router canister is the central canister for this service, it is the entry 
point.
2. **Root**: The root canister implements the `Root Bucket` interface of the spec.
3. **Bucket**: Implements an archive canister that is generated by the `Root Bucket`.
