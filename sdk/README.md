<h3 align="center">Transaction history & asset provenance for NFTâ€™s & Tokens on the Internet Computer</h3>

The CAP SDK is a development kit utilized to integrate CAP to Token/NFTs canisters and interact with the CAP open internet service in general.

**This is meant as an early look into how CAP is integrated/works**, and the code behind it. Visit the [src directory](https://github.com/Psychedelic/cap/tree/cap-sdk/sdk/core/src) and read the `bucket.rs`, `index.rs`, `root.rs`, `router.rs` files for a quick overview.

This repository has the base codebase **(in development)**, for all the canisters involved in the CAP open internet service.

>**IMPORTANT:** CAP is currently in development ðŸš§ and will release in the first week of November, thus it is not on mainnet or usable yet. You might see our documentation is light on the SDK/Main repo still. We're delayed in this to focus on testing, but will soon update this page with guides & detailed examples for developers.
